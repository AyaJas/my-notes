####  When you get advice from someone who makes mistakes, that's pretty good but you don't have to not fall into the same situation either! Because everyone has their own experience.

####  In my opinion, understanding is the golden key to everything in programming, just get smart by writing simple programs, helping your users, and prioritizing your decisions.

#### This is my rule when I was 18 years old, when you have a problem, you have to take a deep breath to make the right decisions, how?
## **sleep on it**

#### Don't ask questions... ask for help
#### Do a search every time you need it, you can find anything you want because if someone solves a complicated problem, I can do that too!
#### **Nobody is better than you these days, you have Google**
**but always ask for advice.**

# Most of the rules and sayings that caught my attention:

+ Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer.
+ Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does.
+ Changes that bring you a lot of value and require a lot of effort are better than those that bring you a lot of value and require a lot of effort.
+ Start small, improve, then expand.
+ Don't expect the future. Just be as public as you know you need to be now.
+ Code should be designed based on what you know now, not based on what you think will happen in the future.  
+ Know that each specific problem has its own solution.
+ Don't be eccentric. Find out when to quit smoking. Don't hesitate to ask for help.

# **Noticeable:**
**I'll read Code Simplicity from Max Kanat-Alexander.**
